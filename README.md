# Online Transactions of 202020V


### Overview:

The startup 202020V was created by myself to unite and expand all developers whom love fashion. Fusing the two worlds as one would allow customers to engage in a deeper level with the products besides wearing them. The transactions were in need of a deeper look and I had to ask my secetary "XYZ" to help. Also went forth with data analysis of the crypto data. Our "Vision Coin" was released and we needed insight ASAP. All data is fictious (imaginary data).Found the .csv file of google and decided to use it. Enjoy!



### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
