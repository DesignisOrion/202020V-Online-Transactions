# Online Transactions of 202020V


### Overview:

The startup 202020V was created by myself to unite and expand all developers whom love fashion. Fusing the two worlds as one would allow customers to engage in a deeper level with the products besides wearing them. The transactions were in need of a deeper look and I had to ask my secetary "XYZ" to help. All data is fictious (made up) into the .csv format. Found it off of google somewhere and decided to use it. Enjoy!

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
